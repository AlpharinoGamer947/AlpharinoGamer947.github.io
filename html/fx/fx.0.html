                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                InnovationFX was a famous vehicle company. They made vehicles with new cutting edge technology. Their
                technology was the most advanced in mankind. They never revealed their processes and materials. Suddenly
                one day the entire company vanished including people, materials, vehicles and other stuff related.
                Rumour says that someone was after their technology to use it for some selfish reasons. So, to keep
                their incredible technology safe, the inventors spread out in the world to hide their inventions so no
                one can get their hands on them.

                Who am I to say these things? I'm Rio and I attend WorldLife International School. WorldLife
                International is one of the 5 schools built by The Genesis Corporation. They are the best company
                because they made many famous inventions that helped the people in Innovative City.As every story
                starts, be happy with life and never ever say life is boring. A single night is enough to change life. I
                learned it the long way. And everything started on that Monday. It was a good day.

            <!-- Chapter 2 -->
            <h3><b>#2 The Graveyard</b></h3><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                With a day like this, it can't get worse right? It did very quickly. After eating dinner, I got my hand
                healed by a healer. And my arm was back to normal. My friends: Gale, Storm, Flame, Frost, Aqua, and
                Flash called me so we could hangout and I silently left my house. We were wandering in the city because
                we were bored. My friend Gale , told us that we could go to The Midnight Restaurant to get a midnight
                snack.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As we were walking to The Midnight Restaurant, we passed through an alleyway. Flash stopped us and told
                us that he saw a creepy green gooey light coming from a small brown rickety wooden door that withstood
                time. As we took a closer look, it looked like a wooden gate than a door. The door had a strange symbol
                and it looked like the letters f and x stuck together.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                We were very curious so we opened the gate and found a lot of vehicles that were rusted. It was like a
                graveyard for vehicles. The fog was mild with a tint of green. Storm pointed out that the fire that was
                present in the graveyard was green, including the moon. There were also a lot of dead trees.
            </p><br>

            <!-- Chapter 3 -->
            <h3><b>#3 The Corroded Vehicle</b></h3><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                As we were wandering around the spooky graveyard, I found a truck, not just any truck, a normal truck
                with a flatbed trailer. Why was it not normal you ask? Because it was completely clean, like a new
                truck. The keys were also in the door lock on the driver's side.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Frost and Flame were quarreling about whether to report this mysterious place to the city authorities. I
                understand that we should report a mysterious graveyard to the authorities but also I wanted it to be
                hidden. All the vehicles we saw had the exact same symbol we found on the wooden gate we entered
                through.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                Gale found a very peculiar vehicle that was close to the truck. It was very dirty and had a lot of rust.
                It was around the size of an SUV. It had spikes in the front of the body and they were green in color.
                The windscreen had the same color as the spikes.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                I was searching for a way to lift the vehicle onto the flatbed and was in the rear of it. There was a
                full sized turbo jet engine, a JET ENGINE! These are found in military jets and airplanes. According to
                Aqua, it's part car, tank, jet and racecar.
